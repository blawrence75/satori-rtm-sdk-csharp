This tutorial leads through a publish-subscribe example in Unity with C# SDK for Satori RTM. The tutorial shows how to connect to RTM, optionally authenticate, publish and subscribe to a channel, and handle important callbacks with results or failures. Along the way, it also covers converting between custom C# classes and JSON formatted messages (sent and received from RTM) and some of the aspects specific to the Unity SDK.
